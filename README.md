## Final Product Expectations

The goal is to create a multifunctional Telegram bot that will become a personal assistant for users in travel planning and organization, offering up-to-date recommendations, the best prices, and booking options. The bot will integrate with various booking platforms and will include its AI to automate the processes of route selection and generating recommendations.

The bot is expected to integrate and/or develop its artificial intelligence (AI) to:
- Automate the route planning process considering user preferences and budgets.
- Develop a recommendation system based on travel data analysis, reviews, and current conditions.
- Create a universal review for travel destinations, including:
  - Analysis of transport connections (transport availability, convenience, and cost).
  - Checking the stability of the political situation and safety level.
  - Monitor weather conditions and provide recommendations on the best time to visit.
  - Availability for visits based on citizenship and visa status (e.g., entry eligibility based on specific passports).

The project aims to generate revenue through paid services, such as booking via the bot, and provide exclusive offers and discounts for users.
